#### Tasks performed by Playbook
1. Uses [SoftLayer API Python Client](https://softlayer-api-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (scli) to order the CentOS VSI
2. Forces VSI to boot using the compiled Linux Kernel
3. Assigns IP address and reboot the VSI to:
	- Pull CoreOS image 
	- Ignition file
	- Install OpenShift Nodes

##  
## Before you begin

- Ansible uses [scli] (https://softlayer-api-python-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to provision resources
- Git to clone source code repository.

> **NOTE:** In addition, contact your Infrastructure master user or account owner to get the following permissions:

> - Network VLAN ID which is a [NAT masquerade to Internet Private Network Uplink through Vyatta](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=solution-tutorials-nat-config-private)
> - [API Key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-classic_keys)

##
## Prerequisites

This tutorial requires:

- Mac book or Linux desktop (CentOS or Redhat) to kick off the ansible playbook. Ensure [ansible is installed](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) by executing the following command.
```
   $ ansible --version
```
- Ensure [pip is installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) by executing the following command.
```
    $ pip --version
```
- Make sure the following packages are installed on Linux Centos/RedHat System
```
   $ yum install git gcc gcc-c++ python-devel cairo-devel gobject-introspection-devel cairo-gobject-devel ansible

 ```
- Make sure the following packages are installed on MacOS System
```
  $ brew install pygobject3 gtk+3 libffi python cairo pkg-config gobject-introspection atk glib
```
- Motion Pro VPN to access IBM Cloud or IC4G.
- Git to clone the source code
- [Private VLAN routed through Vyatta](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=virtual-router-appliance-routing-your-vlans) using [NAT masquerade to Internet](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-router-appliance?topic=solution-tutorials-nat-config-private) for public internet access to pull down OpenShift binaries and updates.

Estimated time:
 The tasks in this tutorial should take about 1 hour of which the VSI provisioning and OpenShift install can take up to 45 minutes.

##  
## Steps

1. Clone the ansible playbook repo:

	```  
	$ git clone https://github.ibm.com/harsingh/OCP_4.X_VSI.git

    ```

2. Run the following command to validate all pre-reqs are installed

	```  
	$ cd OCP_4.X_VSI

	```
    ```
      For MAC OS run the following command
      $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
    
     ```  
	```  
   	$ while read p; do pip install  --ignore-installed ${p}; done <artifacts/pip-req.txt

    ```
     
3. Copy the variable file:

	```  
	$ cp vars.yaml.template vars.yaml

    ```
4. Update the variables in var.yaml file
	```  
	$ vi vars.yaml

    ```

5. Execute the bash script to run the playbook
	```  
	$ chmod +x create_ocp_instance.sh delete_ocp_instance.sh

    ```

	```  
	$ ./create_ocp_instance.sh

    ```
##  
## Verify OpenShift install

In this section, you are going to verify the installed OpenShift to make sure it has been created successfully.

**Verify VM**

1. Log into IBM Cloud or IC4G
2. On the left side menu, click on **Infrastructure** to view the list of virtual server devices.
3. Click **Devices** -> **Device List** to find the server created. You should see your server device listed.

**Verify OpenShift**
1. The last task of the ansible playbook prints out a message with userid and password, as shown below
```
> TASK [validate_ic4g_ocp_servers : debug] **********************************************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [10.5X.9X.4X] => {
    "openshiftcomplete.stderr_lines": [
        "level=info msg=\"Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster at https://api.wdc01.ibm.com:6443 to initialize...\"",
        "level=info msg=\"Waiting up to 10m0s for the openshift-console route to be created...\"",
        "level=info msg=\"Install complete!\"",
        "level=info msg=\"To access the cluster as the system:admin user when using 'oc', run 'export KUBECONFIG=/opt/ocp4/auth/kubeconfig'\"",
        "level=info msg=\"Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.wdc01.ibm.com\"",
        "level=info msg=\"Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: eXh7T-YkjJ6-VCXji-DfZXV\""
```
2. Add Helper node IP address to your DNS or /etc/hosts file for example

> <helpernode_ip_address> console-openshift-console.apps.<base_domain_prefix>.<base_domain> oauth-openshift.apps.<base_domain_prefix>.<base_domain>


3. Open a browser and type in the following URL and login in as with the OpenShift user id (kubeadmin, in this example).

> https://console-openshift-console.apps.<base_domain_prefix>.<base_domain>  

## Summary

Hopefully, you found this tutorial helpful and educational by deploying OpenShift 4.X on the virtual classic infrastructure layer. Once the OCP 4.X solution is deployed, it inherits all of the advantages of the IBM Cloud advantages; for example, Elasticity of CPU and Memory and Disk. The Ansible Playbook supports N number of worker nodes as part of the Cluster from day one install and the deployment inherits all the security features provided by CoreOS.
