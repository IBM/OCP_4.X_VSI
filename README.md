# Deploy OpenShift 4.X on Classic IBM Cloud Infrastructure or IC4G

##

## Introduction

The purpose of this tutorial is to install OpenShift 4.X on IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure or on IBM Cloud for Government (IC4G) VSI&#39;s. By following this tutorial, you will get all the advantage of inheriting IaaS FedRAMP high controls from the IC4G infrastructure layer and use OpenShift to deploy container workloads on enterprise grade cloud. Enterprise customers will have complete control of the Management and Data Plane of OpenShift to manage the environment entirely as they have done on-premises. The organization that has invested in IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure can reuse the techniques and knowledge to deploy OpenShift 4.X. The cost of standing OpenShift can be set to either hourly or monthly. Organizations can quickly scale OpenShift to meet dev, test, and prod use-case environments. It also provides the option to update OpenShift on an independent schedule to fit with a project timeline.
